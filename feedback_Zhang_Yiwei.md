# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] The answer to what the mystery code script does is almost correct. But it only outputs one number, so how can it output all prime numbers between and 1 and 100?

### Feedback Week 5:

- [ ]  The code for counting DNA nucleotides does the counting correctly and correctly displays the results in a pie chart. However, it should ask the user to input a DNA sequence, instead of hard-coding the DNA sequence in the script.

- [ ] The code for reversing the words in a string and sorting them works fine, but the script should ask the user for input instead of hard-coding the string.



This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 90 out of 100
