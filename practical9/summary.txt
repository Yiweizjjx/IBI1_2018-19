Summary of findings

mouse human comparison
BLOSUM62 score: 1091 
Noramlised BLOSUM62 score: 4.914
Identity: 89.64%

mouse random seq comparison
BLOSUM62 score: -250 
Noramlised BLOSUM62 score: -1.126
Identity: 5.86%

human random seq comparison
BLOSUM62 score: -250 
Noramlised BLOSUM62 score: -1.126
Identity: 5.41%

BLOSUM score has been normalised to sequence length. With this normalised score, we can compare the similarity between two sequnences of different length in a meaningful way.
Sequence for human SOD62 protein and Sequence for mouse SOD62 protein are quite similar, as the identity value is about 90%.
It is noticeable that mouse random seq comparison and human random seq comparison have the same BLOSUM62 score with different identity values. So, we can not simply compare two sequences merely with BLOSUM62 score. Other parameters are needed to have a better evaluation of two sequences.
